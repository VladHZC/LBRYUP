# LBRY.UP 0.2 [UPDATE] 

The first time I interacted with LBRY api, was to make [LBRY.UP 0.1](https://cutt.ly/bkt6bis). It's a tool to recover videos that exists on the internet, that you can use if: 
-  you don't have access to it anymore
-  backup intentions
-  if you don't have youtube sync on

After downloading the recovered video it posts on LBRY network and now you're safe :)

While I was working on [LBRY toolkit 0.2](https://cutt.ly/Ckt6OJi) using Tkinter Gui interface I took the opportunity to give LBRYUP a new look.

> 1. You must have python installed on your path 
> 2. If you do and you are using Windows you just need to click on .bat file and it will run 
> 3. If you are using a new version of Windows 10, may be you'll need to install ```msvcr100.dll``` which I've added on the GitHub Repo. 
> 4. You must have LBRY app or lbrynet running along

### With great powers, comes great responsability

- IF YOU USE IT FOR POSTING CONTENT THAT IS **NOT YOURS** OR FOR DOING ANY SHADY THING YOU CAN AND **YOU WILL LOSE** YOUR LBC CREATORS REWARDS AND BATMAN WILL MAKE YOU A VISIT AND OTHER BAD THINGS WILL HAPPEN, UNLESS YOU ARE A CYPHERPUNK TRYING TO SAVE THE WORLD, IN THAT CASE THAT'S OK BUT YOU STILL **DON'T GET REWARDS FROM IT**, MAY BE TIPS, FROM OTHER PIRATE. AND BE CAREFUL .BAT CALLS BATMAN
